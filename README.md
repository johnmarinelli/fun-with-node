=============

My first node app.  IP: http://54.187.27.254/ (not live yet)

This app uses yql, mysql, Chart.js, and a custom utility module.  Cron runs query-and-store.js every day and puts data into a table, then the client requests from that same table.<br>It's relatively simple, but I've learned a lot doing it.
